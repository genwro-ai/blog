# Hey there! Welcome to the genwro.AI Blog ðŸš€

We're thrilled to kick off our research blog! Since you're here, let us give you the scoop on who we are and what we're planning to share.

## Meet genwro.AI

We are a research group from WrocÅ‚aw University of Science and Technology established in 2019. Our research spans several key areas in artificial intelligence and machine learning:
- generative models: developing and advancing state-of-the-art architectures for content generation and synthesis,
- 3D representation learning: exploring novel approaches to understanding and representing three-dimensional structures in machine learning systems,
- few-shot learning: investigating methods to enable effective learning from limited data samples,
- uncertainty estimation: advancing techniques for reliable uncertainty quantification and out-of-distribution detection in ML models,
- computer vision: focusing on image segmentation, restoration, and video generation with particular emphasis on real-world applications,
- explainable AI: developing methods for interpretable machine learning, with emphasis on counterfactual explanations and model transparency,
- probabilistic models: investigating Bayesian approaches and probabilistic frameworks for robust machine learning systems.

We're not working in isolation &mdash; we're part of a broader research community, collaborating with amazing teams from places like University of Cambridge, Imperial College London, ETH Zurich, and several other fantastic institutions.

You might have spotted our work at conferences like NeurIPS, AAAI, ICML, and ICLR.

While we're collaborating globally, our heart is in WrocÅ‚aw! We're proud to be an active part of the local tech scene. You'll often find us sharing knowledge at local meetups, giving talks, and engaging with the vibrant WrocÅ‚aw tech community. Keep an eye out for us at local tech events &mdash; we're always up for interesting discussions and sharing our passion for AI. :wink:

## What's Coming Up on This Blog?

We want this blog to be your go-to spot for:

- updates on our latest research adventures,
- regular "What We're Reading" posts where we break down fascinating papers,
- clear, no-nonsense tutorials about ML concepts,
- real research insights that you can actually use.

Whether you're neck-deep in research papers or just curious about what's happening in AI, we're aiming to share content that matters. 

**No fluff**, **no hype** (which is currently killing any reasonable voice in AI field), just genuine insights from our day-to-day work.

## Looking Ahead

We've got exciting content planned! One of our first series will dive into counterfactual explanations - starting with a friendly introduction to the fundamentals, then sharing insights from our research in this area. Beyond that, we're preparing posts about our other research directions, where we'll combine theoretical foundations with practical insights from our work.
